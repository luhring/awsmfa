## Background

MFA ([multi-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication)) has become an extremely popular and successful security mechanism to defend against situations where passwords or secret keys are unexpectedly exposed to an attacker.

AWS allows IAM policies to specify that the listed permissions are available to a user (or to a user's group/role) only when the user has first authenticated with an MFA device. AWS provides more information on this setup in ["Configuring MFA-Protected API Access"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_configure-api-require.html).

To access the AWS API using local command line tools, while needing to perform actions that require that you authenticate with MFA, you must first obtain temporary access credentials via the [GetSessionToken](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetSessionToken.html) or [AssumeRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) API methods. These methods require that you supply several parameters, including your MFA device's serial number and the currently displayed token.

awsmfa makes this process easier for users by providing a simple syntax for providing your MFA device's token code, and it automatically saves your temporary credentials to disk for use in future commands. awsmfa also makes it easy to discard the temporary credentials and restore your original credentials back to their original location.

## Usage

Prerequisites for using this tool:

1. You must have already obtained access credentials (access key ID and secret access key) for an IAM user in an AWS account.
1. These credentials should (ideally) be saved in your local `credentials` file ‚Äî- see ["Configuration and Credential Files"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) for help setting this up ‚Äî- but can alternatively be stored in [AWS-specific environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html). Currently, if your credentials are saved to a `credentials` file, they must be stored in the "default" profile within the file.
1. You must have associated a virtual MFA device with your IAM user. If you need help doing this, check out ["Enabling a Virtual Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) Device (Console)"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable_virtual.html).

**Note:** your experience will be smoother if you store your credentials in a `credentials` file and you _don't_ have AWS-specific environment variables set.

### Syntax

`awsmfa [commands] [mfa-token]`

(`mfa-token` must be the currently displayed numeric MFA token from the device you've configured as a virtual MFA device associated with your IAM user.)

### Commands

`-h`, `--help`: Show this help text. _(Don't specify an `mfa-token` with this command.)_

`-r`, `--restore`: Restore original credentials back to AWS credentials file. _(Don't specify an `mfa-token` with this command.)_

### Examples

To obtain temporary session credentials from AWS and save to credentials file:

```bash
$ awsmfa 123456
Backed up credentials file to /Users/dan/.aws/credentials_backup_by_awsmfa
Multi-factor authentication was successful
Saved new session credentials to credentials file

You now have access to actions where your IAM policies require 'MultiFactorAuthPresent' üëç
```

To switch back to using permanent access credentials:

```bash
$ awsmfa --restore
Restored original credentials from backup
```

## Limitations

- **Only compatible with _virtual_ MFA devices.** One way that awsmfa makes the authentication process simpler for users is that it doesn't ask the user for the MFA device serial number. awsmfa accomplishes this by making the assumption that the user is using a **virtual** MFA device, as opposed to [the other types of MFA devices that can be used with AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable.html). awsmfa also assumes that this virtual MFA device's ARN can be derived using the format `arn:aws:iam::<aws-account-number>:mfa/<iam-user-name>`.
- **Only supports the "default" profile in credentials files.** awsmfa doesn't allow users to specify a profile to use when making the request for temporary credentials. awsmfa also doesn't support saving the obtained temporary credentials to any other place besides the "default" profile in the `credentials` file. This just hasn't been implemented yet, and this can be addressed in a future release.
- **Session duration for temporary credentials can't be customized (always set to 6 hours).** This just hasn't been implemented yet, and this can be addressed in a future release.
- **Can't be used to assume a role.** This just hasn't been implemented yet, and this can be addressed in a future release.

## Road map

- ~~Ability to get a session token via default profile~~
- Ability to specify custom session duration
- Ability to use non-default profiles
- Ability to assume a role
